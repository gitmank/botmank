# botmank - a discord bot

botmank is a discord bot that uses the PythonRreddit API Wrapper (PRAW).

responds to messages starting with __```mank```__. I hope to add music, role management, quirky replies and other functionality. It has these basic commands right now -

```mank hello``` - responds with heyy

```mank meme```  - sends a random meme from r/memes hot 100
